                    Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and due to it's proximity it is not easily seen except during twilight.

                <h2>From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as 11 times brighter.</h2>

                    For every two orbts of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the Sun.Thirteen times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in an event called a transit.
